# Minimalist 8-bit multicycle RISC CPU

This work is based on the following [implementation](https://www.impulsmittelschule.ch/download/pictures/66/hrqlabj8v1012ahyxg72kczftahd5a/1_unger_benjamin-1552318104.pdf) from Benjamin Unger: _8-Bit Multicycle Processor Design and Implementation in Verilog_. 

I made my own SystemVerilog code based on the instruction set and diagrams exposed in the mentioned reference.

Work in progress...
